# Hardcoded FAQ Modal Implementation

## Problem
The original FAQ modal implementation was fetching content from a text file (`/how_auto_scroll_works_and_key_codes.txt`) which may be causing issues in the Vercel deployment.

## Solution
Created a hardcoded version of the FAQ modal that doesn't rely on fetching external content:

1. Created a new component `HardcodedFAQModal.js` with the FAQ content directly included in the JSX.
2. Modified `AccessiblePDFViewer.js` to import and use this hardcoded version instead of the original.

## Files Changed

### 1. Created new file: `/src/components/HardcodedFAQModal.js`
- Used the same styling as the original FAQModal (imports the same CSS file)
- Content is hardcoded directly in the component rather than fetched
- Maintains the same structure and formatting as the original
- Preserves the escape key event listener functionality

### 2. Modified: `/src/AccessiblePDFViewer.js`
- Changed the import from `FAQModal` to `HardcodedFAQModal`
- Updated the component usage in the render function

## Implementation Details

The hardcoded FAQ modal:
- Contains all sections from the original text file
- Preserves the formatting and structure
- Maintains the same CSS styling
- Retains the same functionality (escape key to close)
- Has the same props interface (`isOpen` and `onClose`)

This implementation should work in Vercel since it no longer depends on successfully fetching the text file at runtime.

## Next Steps

After deploying to Vercel:
1. Verify that the FAQ modal appears correctly when the FAQ button is clicked
2. Confirm that all the FAQ content is displayed properly
3. Test that the modal can be closed using both the 'X' button and the Escape key
