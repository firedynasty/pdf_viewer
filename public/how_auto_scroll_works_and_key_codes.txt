HOW AUTO-SCROLL WORKS IN THE PDF VIEWER

The PDF Auto-Scroll feature automatically advances through PDF pages at a specified interval. Here's how it works:

KEY CONTROLS:
-------------
- Press the '/' key to toggle auto-scroll ON/OFF
- Press 'm' to manually go to the next page (resets scroll position)
- Press ',' to manually go to the next page (maintains scroll position)
- Press 'z' to manually go to the previous page (maintains scroll position)
- Press 'x' to scroll up within the current page
- Press 'c' to scroll down within the current page
- Press 'o' to scroll to the top of the current page (like Home key)
- Press 'p' to scroll to the bottom of the current page (like End key)
- Press 'r' to return to the homepage/file selection screen
- Press 'Spacebar' on the homepage to open the file selection dialog

PAGE NAVIGATION:
--------------
- Click on the page number to edit it directly and navigate to a specific page
- Press Enter after editing to confirm and navigate to that page

AUTO-SCROLL FEATURES:
--------------------
1. When activated (SCROLL ON), the viewer will automatically advance through pages:
   - At normal zoom (100%): Uses the ',' key method that preserves scroll position
   - When zoomed in: First scrolls to the bottom of the current page (like 'p' key), then advances to next page

2. Speed Control:
   - The "-" button increases scrolling speed (reduces interval time)
   - The "+" button decreases scrolling speed (increases interval time)
   - Default interval is 13 seconds

3. Sound Feedback:
   - Toggle sound ON/OFF via radio buttons
   - When enabled, a subtle audio beep plays when changing pages

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
---------------------
- Auto-scroll uses a timer (setInterval) that checks if enough time has passed since the last page change
- When the interval elapses, it automatically clicks the Next button
- The scroll timer resets whenever you manually navigate pages
- Error handling prevents issues if the PDF fails to load correctly
- The system automatically disables auto-scroll after multiple errors

TIPS:
----
- For large pages, use 'x' and 'c' keys to navigate up and down before moving to the next page
- Better yet, can use 'o' and 'p' as home and page down when zoomed in to 150% larger pages.
- 'm' will go to next page
- Set a comfortable interval based on your reading speed (slower for detailed content)
- You can temporarily pause auto-scrolling by pressing '/' and resume again with the same key



BUILDING: 
    pdfContainer.scrollTo({                                     │ │
│ │ 287            top: 0,                                                   │ │
│ │ 288            behavior: 'smooth'                                        │ │
│ │ 289          });                                                         │ │
│ │ 290          e.preventDefault(); // Prevent default browser behavior     │ │
│ │ 291        } else if (e.key === 'p' || e.key === 'P') {                  │ │
│ │ 292          // Scroll to bottom of the page (like End key)              │ │
│ │ 293          pdfContainer.scrollTo({                                     │ │
│ │ 294            top: pdfContainer.scrollHeight,                           │ │
│ │ 295            behavior: 'smooth'   

I would like to change how autoscroll works if the <span>100%</span> zoom is regular then keep the regular autoscroll, however if it is zoomed in , then I would like to check if  top: pdfContainer.scrollHeight,  is not at this then move it to this (like next page) and once at this then go to the next page with "m"
