HOW AUTO-SCROLL WORKS IN THE PDF VIEWER

The PDF Auto-Scroll feature automatically advances through PDF pages at a specified interval. Here's how it works:

KEY CONTROLS:
-------------
- Press the '/' key to toggle auto-scroll ON/OFF
- Press 'm' to manually go to the next page (resets scroll position)
- Press ',' to manually go to the next page (maintains scroll position)
- Press 'z' to manually go to the previous page (maintains scroll position)
- Press 'o' to scroll to the top of the current page (like Home key)
- Press 'p' to scroll to the bottom of the current page (like End key)

PAGE NAVIGATION:
--------------
- Click on the page number to edit it directly and navigate to a specific page
- Press Enter after editing to confirm and navigate to that page

AUTO-SCROLL FEATURES:
--------------------
1. When activated (SCROLL ON), the viewer will automatically advance through pages:
   - At normal zoom (100%): Uses the ',' key method that preserves scroll position
   - When zoomed in: First scrolls to the bottom of the current page (like 'p' key), then advances to next page

2. Speed Control:
   - The "-" button increases scrolling speed (reduces interval time)
   - The "+" button decreases scrolling speed (increases interval time)
   - Default interval is 13 seconds

3. Sound Feedback:
   - Toggle sound ON/OFF via radio buttons
   - When enabled, a subtle audio beep plays when changing pages

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
---------------------
- Auto-scroll uses a timer (setInterval) that checks if enough time has passed since the last page change
- When the interval elapses, it automatically clicks the Next button
- The scroll timer resets whenever you manually navigate pages
- Error handling prevents issues if the PDF fails to load correctly
- The system automatically disables auto-scroll after multiple errors
