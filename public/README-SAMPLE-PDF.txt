To add sample PDF files for the application:

1. Place any PDF files you want to use in this directory (public/)
2. Files in this directory will be available at the root path of your application
   For example, a file named "sample.pdf" in this directory would be available at:
   http://localhost:3000/sample.pdf (in development)
   or https://your-app-name.vercel.app/sample.pdf (when deployed)

3. You can download free sample PDFs from:
   - https://www.adobe.com/support/products/enterprise/knowledgecenter/media/c4611_sample_explain.pdf (Adobe sample)
   - https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf (W3C dummy PDF)

These files will be included in your build and deployed to Vercel.
